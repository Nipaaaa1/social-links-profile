## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [Motion One](https://motion.dev/) - For Animation


### What I learned

This time, I'd try to use *Svelte* instead of React. It's actually much more simpler to use. But, I still didn't know a lot about it. Maybe because I'm using *React* too much.

I also use *Motion One* which kinda like *Framer Motion* but with vanilla Javascript. It had less features but at least I could use it with anything.

### Continued development

I'd like to try another JS Library like Vue.

### Useful resources
